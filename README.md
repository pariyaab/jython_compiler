# compiler_project
A basic compiler for JYTHON , currently in development and supporting lexical and syntactic parsing and common errors, a listener and inheritance tree walker.
jython is a combination of java and python language. In this project I write a simple compiler for that and cover some errors that may occur during the compiler process.
